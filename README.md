# Git 

To automate the process of committing and pushing to GitHub after a change or addition of a file, you can use a shell script or a batch file that executes the necessary Git commands. 

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```

For Clone the Repo:

git clone `https://oauth2:TOKEN@github.com/username/repo.git`

It is better to enter the token at the beginning when cloning Repo to avoid the request or the error of the push after.
